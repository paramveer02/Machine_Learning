# Machine_Learning
In this Classification Repository, i have downloaded different types of data sets from Kaggle in .csv format, such as, Titanic Passengers data, SVM petal and Sepal, Heart patients data, Diabetic Patients data and loan sanction data and imported them to my jupyter notebook using Pandas and then performed the following stages on the imported data

Data Collection (pandas)
Data Visualization through graphs, pie charts, heatmaps using seaborn, matplotlib, boxplots, catplots, heatmaps etc
Data Wrangling using numpy, pandas determine null values and accordingly worked on them
Model Creation and Training using Scikit-learn, train-test-split
Machine Learning Classification algorithms applied to the models
Determind model score, accuracy of each algorithm, classification report and respective predictions.
